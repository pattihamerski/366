    "`for` loops are a computing tool that we used to repeatedly run the same chunk of code a pre-determned number of times. For example, we can loop over the numbers 0, 1, 2, ..., 8, 9 by writing `for i in range(10):`, or we can loop over the elements of a list named `periodic_table` by writing `for elem in periodic_table:`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, which you will explore today, a `while` loop can be useful instead of a `for` loop. To see a comparison, the code chunks below serve the same purpose (summing the numbers 0 through 9), but use different loop structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Snippet 1\n",
    "\n",
    "sum = 0\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    sum += i\n",
    "print(sum)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Snippet 2\n",
    "\n",
    "sum = 0\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "while i < 10:\n",
    "    sum += i\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "print(sum)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Snippet 1**, the `for` loop iterates through the range, assigning each value to `i`, starting with `0`, and stopping before `10`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In **Snippet 2**, the `while` loop iterates continuously as long as `i < 10` is true. `i` is incremented inside the loop (`i += 1`), so in effect the loop will run when `i = 0, 1, 2, ...` and then stops when `i` reaches `10`, because of the `i < 10` condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The \"hidden\" line of code:** Both `while` loops and `for` loops instruct the computer to repeatedly run code, but a main difference is that `for` loops have an additional hidden line of code that `while` loops don't. The `for` loop in the example above includes a hidden command for the computer to set `i = {next number in range(10)}` during each iteration of the loop. The `while` loop has no such hidden command, and therefore we needed to set `i = 0` and `i += 1` manually."
