    "Today, you will apply the Euler method to a physics problem. To review, the Euler method uses a **known derivative** to iteratively approximate values of an **unknown physical quantity**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps of the Euler method are:\n",
    "1. Begin with an unknown function $y(x)$, where we **do** know a formula for the derivative $f(x,y) = \\frac{dy}{dx}$ and initial values for $y$ and $x$, which we can call $y_0$ and $x_0$. *Note: the function can use different variables than $y$ and $x$, but they should represent a dependent and independent variable, respectively.*\n",
    "2. Select a range of equally spaced $x$-values to compute over, starting with $x_0$.\n",
    "3. Go to the next $x$-value, $x_1$. The step-size, $x_1 - x_0$, we can call $\\Delta x$.\n",
    "4. Compute $y(x_1)$, or just $y_1$ for short, by using the Euler method: $ y_1 = y_0 + f(x_0, y_0)\\Delta x$.\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 3 and 4, using the same step-size ($\\Delta x$), to get to the next $x$-value.\n",
    "6. Continue repeating until you reach the end of your range of $x$-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "When repeating the steps of the Euler method, we can use a more general formula for computing the next value of $y(x)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_{i+1} = y_i + f(x_i, y_i)\\Delta x $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you can visualize this process and see how the formula is derived:\n",
